# Google Sign-In Development Guide

## Current Issue
The error you're seeing occurs because `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` requires native modules that aren't available in Expo Go.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Expo Development Build (Recommended)
1. **Install EAS CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Expo**:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. **Configure EAS**:
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

4. **Create a development build**:
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   # or for Android
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

5. **Install the development build** on your device/simulator

### Option 2: Use Physical Device with Expo Go
- Google Sign-In works better on physical devices
- Some native modules have better support on real devices

### Option 3: Test Other Authentication Methods
- Email/Password authentication works in Expo Go
- Anonymous/Guest authentication works in Expo Go
- You can test the app flow without Google Sign-In

## Current Status
✅ **Fixed**: The app now gracefully handles Google Sign-In unavailability
✅ **Fixed**: Clear error messages when Google Sign-In is not available
✅ **Fixed**: The app continues to work with other authentication methods

## Testing
1. **In Expo Go**: You'll see "Google Sign-In (Not Available in Expo Go)" 
2. **Email/Password**: Works normally
3. **Anonymous Sign-In**: Works normally
4. **App Flow**: All other features work normally

## Next Steps
1. Test the app with email/password authentication
2. Create a development build when ready to test Google Sign-In
3. The Google Sign-In configuration is already set up and ready to use
